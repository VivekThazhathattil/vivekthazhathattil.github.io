					<p>A man who never hesitated to raise his voice against corruption; A man who is known for his simplicity and dedication- At his core, Achuthanandan has always been a fighter. This Marxist veteran, who is claimed to be one of the most popular Communist leaders alive, continues to evoke genuine affection among the masses of Kerala, a south-Indian state where he had formerly served as the Chief Minister.</p>
					<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p> He was born on 20<sup>th</sup> October 1923 to Sankaran and Accamma in Punnapra, Alappuzha, Travancore (part of present-day Kerala state, India). He had lost his parents at a very early age, which forced him to quit studies and look for jobs. He worked at his elder brother's tailoring shop and later worked at a coir factory. It was in there that he began exhibiting his organization and leadership skills to help agricultural and coir factory workers. He was soon initiated into various political movements and eventually in the freedom movement and the Communist movement. The police weren't impressed by his progress and locked him up in prison for five and a half years where he was severely punished for his actions.</p>
					<h3>Evolution as a leader</h3>

					<p> None of these hardships could extinguish the flame of revolution that was deep rooted in Achuthananthan's ideologies. He entered politics through trade union activities and joined State Congress. Later, he became a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI). His growth as a prominent leader gained him friends and enemies both within his party and outside. He did not give up when he failed to win during 1996 elections. He fought hard and won the assembly elections of 2006 with over a margin of 20,000 votes and sworn in as Chief Minister of Kerala.</p>
					<h3>Notable Achievements</h3>
